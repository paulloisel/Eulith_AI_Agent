The function EulithWeb3() takes 3 required arguments:
- first: the Eulith_url which define on which network you want to use for the transaction (the list of the available network is here: https://docs.eulith.com/v/hgbRx2t48xMLL5xhyh04/rpc-endpoints/overview-and-base-urls)
- second: your Eulith refresh Token that you can find or generate here: https://www.eulithclient.com/home
- third: the construct_signing_middleware() method with your custody method pasted in as an argument.

The function LocalSigner() takes 1 argument: the PRIVATE_KEY of your wallet as a string. Careful! This custody method is not secure and should be used only for testing.

The method eulith_get_erc_token() takes 1 argument: a TokenSymbol (the list of the available TokenSymbol is here: https://docs.eulith.com/v/hgbRx2t48xMLL5xhyh04/client-libraries/python/tokens). It returns an instance of either the EulithERC20 or EulithWETH class. We need this type of object because the DEX recognizes only ERC-20 tokens. Then ETH will be wrapped into EulithWETH objects and other tokens wrapped in EulithERC20 to trade in DEX.

The method get_balance() is called on the ew3 Eulith object and takes 1 argument, the wallet.address, of the wallet you want to check.
