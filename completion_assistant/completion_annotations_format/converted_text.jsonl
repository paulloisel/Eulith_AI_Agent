"The Step 5,6,7, and 9 are optional (they are used only if the transaction is atomic).\nIn the case the transaction is not atomic, then you don't need a toolkit and use only steps 1,2,3,4 and 8.\n\nIn a nutshell:\n- if the transaction is atomic all steps from 1 to 9 must be used\n- if the transaction is non-atomic, only steps 1,2,3,4 and 8 are required."
