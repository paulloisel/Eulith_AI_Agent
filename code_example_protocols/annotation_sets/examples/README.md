What does 'sys.path.insert(0, os.getcwd())' does ?

By default, Python only searches for modules and packages in predefined sets of directories, so we add current working directory to beginning of system path to allow Python to find modules and packages that are located in the current working directory when running the script using 'sys.path.insert(0, os.getcwd())'
