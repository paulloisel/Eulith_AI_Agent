EulithWeb3():
1. Takes 3 required arguments:
- first: the Eulith_url as a string which define on which network you want to use for the transaction (the list of the available network is here: https://docs.eulith.com/v/hgbRx2t48xMLL5xhyh04/rpc-endpoints/overview-and-base-urls)
- second: your Eulith refresh Token as a string (find or generated here: https://www.eulithclient.com/home)
- third: the construct_signing_middleware() method with your a custody method pasted in as an argument (several custody method explained here: https://docs.eulith.com/v/hgbRx2t48xMLL5xhyh04/client-libraries/python/custody-signers)
2. Outpus a Eulith Web3 object you should use the variable name "ew3" by convention.
3. c will be the based of the entire protocol. Indeed, most of the Eulith's methods required for the transactions will be called on this object. 

LocalSigner():
1. Takes 1 argument: the PRIVATE_KEY of your wallet as a string.
2. Outputs a LocalSigner object with your wallet signature.
3. LocalSigner() is the easiest but less secure custody method available with Eulith's protocols. It sould be used only for testing/development and never in a production environment. You provide a signature to allow write-action on-chain to be performed.
